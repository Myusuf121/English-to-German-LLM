# English-to-German-LLM
This project implements a transformer-based neural machine translation system from scratch using PyTorch. We’ll build a model “**English-to-German Audio Translation with Transformers**” that translates English audio to German, following the architecture from the groundbreaking “Attention Is All You Need” paper.

**Data Preparation and Preprocessing:** Installing datasets package and importing necessary libraries for this project.
!pip install datasets 

**Embeddings and Positional Encoding**
First, we need to convert our text into a format the model can understand. The InputEmbeddings class converts words into dense vector. Since transformers process all words simultaneously (unlike RNNs), we need to add positional information. The PositionalEncoding class adds sinusoidal position encodings to help the model understand word order.

**The Heart of the Transformer: Multi-Head Attention**
**The Encoder-Decoder Architecture**
The transformer uses multiple encoder and decoder layers stacked on top of each other. Each encoder block processes the input sequence, while decoder blocks generate the translation one word at a time.

**Training the Model**
The model is trained on the WMT14 English-German dataset. We use tokenizers to convert text into numerical sequences and implement special tokens for sentence boundaries and padding.

**Key Implementation Details**
Some important aspects of our implementation include:

Layer normalization for stable training
Residual connections to help with gradient flow
Dropout for regularization
Xavier initialization for model parameters
Causal masking in the decoder to prevent looking at future tokens

**Conclusion**
Building a transformer from scratch helps understand the inner workings of modern translation systems. While production systems are more complex and optimized, this implementation covers the core concepts that make transformers work.

The full code includes additional components for training, evaluation, and inference. Feel free to experiment with the hyperparameters and architecture to see how they affect translation quality.
